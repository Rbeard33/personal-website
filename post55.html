            <p>Struggling with grogginess or a lack of focus in the morning? Dr. Andrew Huberman’s morning protocol combines neuroscience and practical tips to help you optimize your mornings and set the tone for a productive day.</p>

            <h2>1. Morning Sunlight</h2>
            <p>Expose your eyes to 10–30 minutes of morning sunlight within the first hour of waking. This helps regulate your circadian rhythm, improve energy levels, and enhance mood. If sunlight isn’t an option, consider a 10,000 lux light therapy lamp as an alternative.</p>

            <h2>2. Hydration is Key</h2>
            <p>Start your day with 16–32 ounces of water, optionally with a pinch of salt and a squeeze of lemon to replenish electrolytes. After hours of fasting while sleeping, hydration is critical for optimal brain and body function.</p>

            <h2>3. Delay Coffee Intake</h2>
            <p>Resist the urge to drink coffee immediately after waking. Instead, wait 60–90 minutes to allow your cortisol levels to regulate naturally. This avoids energy crashes later in the day and promotes more sustainable focus.</p>

            <h2>4. Cold Exposure</h2>
            <p>Incorporate cold showers or cold plunges into your morning. A 1–3 minute exposure activates dopamine release, builds resilience, and gives an immediate energy boost to start your day strong.</p>

            <h2>5. High-Protein Breakfast</h2>
            <p>Consume a breakfast rich in protein (30–40 grams) to stabilize your energy and prevent crashes. Great options include eggs, Greek yogurt, or protein shakes with clean ingredients.</p>

            <h2>6. Supplements to Support Energy and Focus</h2>
            <p>Consider adding the following science-backed supplements to your morning routine:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>L-Theanine</strong>: Promotes calm focus, especially when paired with caffeine.</li>
                <li><strong>Alpha-GPC</strong>: Supports memory, focus, and cognitive performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Vitamin D3</strong>: Essential for energy and immune health, especially in darker months.</li>
                <li><strong>Omega-3 Fatty Acids</strong>: Boosts brain health and reduces inflammation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>7. Movement and Breathing</h2>
            <p>Get your body moving with a 5–10 minute light workout or breathing exercises. This primes your nervous system and helps you transition into the day with clarity and focus.</p>

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>Huberman’s morning protocol is a powerful yet simple set of steps to optimize energy, mood, and focus. Whether you adopt all the practices or start with just one, these changes can make a huge difference in how you tackle your day.</p>
