            <h2>Peter Attia’s Protocol to Optimize Heart Health and Prevent Cardiovascular Disease</h2>
            <p>Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death worldwide, but it doesn't have to be inevitable. Dr. Peter Attia offers a science-backed approach to minimize risks and optimize your heart health. Let’s dive into the key strategies and break down concepts like VO2 max for a better understanding.</p>
            
            <h3>What is VO2 Max and Why It Matters?</h3>
            <p>VO2 max measures your body’s efficiency in utilizing oxygen during intense exercise. It’s strongly linked to cardiovascular health and longevity.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What it Measures:</strong> Heart, lung, and muscle efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>Why It’s Critical:</strong> Higher VO2 max reduces cardiovascular risks.</li>
                <li><strong>How to Improve:</strong> Incorporate HIIT, Zone 2 cardio, and progressive overload in workouts.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Other Critical Components</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Metabolic Health:</strong> Prioritize low-glycemic foods, strength training, and intermittent fasting.</li>
                <li><strong>Lipid Management:</strong> Optimize LDL levels with dietary changes and Omega-3 supplements.</li>
                <li><strong>Blood Pressure Control:</strong> Exercise regularly, reduce sodium intake, and eat potassium-rich foods.</li>
                <li><strong>Inflammation Management:</strong> Focus on exercise, good sleep, and anti-inflammatory foods.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Additional Metrics to Track</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Coronary artery calcium (CAC) score to assess heart disease risk.</li>
                <li>Apolipoprotein B (ApoB) levels as a better risk marker than LDL cholesterol.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The 80/20 Rule for Heart Health</h3>
            <p>If you're short on time, focus on these two key actions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>VO2 Max:</strong> Prioritize HIIT and Zone 2 cardio for the biggest cardiovascular benefits.</li>
                <li><strong>Metabolic Health:</strong> Stick to a low-glycemic diet and include strength training to improve insulin sensitivity.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Small, consistent actions can lead to significant improvements in your cardiovascular health.</p>
