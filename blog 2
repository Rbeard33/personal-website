## The Origins of Friday the 13th: Legend and Lore
The fear of Friday the 13th is a combination of two things: **the number 13** and **Friday itself**—both of which have historically been viewed with suspicion.

### The Number 13
Many cultures considered the number 12 to be “complete” (12 months in a year, 12 zodiac signs, etc.). Adding one more felt unnatural and chaotic.

### Friday’s Reputation
In Christianity, Friday is believed to be the day of the **Crucifixion** of Jesus. Over time, the day gained a gloomy reputation. A famous event tied to this date is **Friday, October 13, 1307**, when the **Knights Templar** were arrested and executed by King Philip IV of France.
