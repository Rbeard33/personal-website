            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Meditation is no longer just for monks or spiritual gurus—it's for anyone seeking calm, clarity, and focus. Whether you're new to meditation or looking to deepen your practice, this guide breaks down popular forms of meditation and offers practical tips to get started quickly.</p>

            <h2>Common Forms of Meditation</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Transcendental Meditation (TM):</strong> Involves silently repeating a specific mantra for 20 minutes, twice a day. Great for reducing stress and promoting relaxation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Mindfulness Meditation:</strong> Focuses on being present and aware of your thoughts, feelings, and sensations without judgment. Tools like the Headspace app can help you get started.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Guided Meditation:</strong> Ideal for beginners, guided meditations walk you through relaxation techniques with a narrator. YouTube, Calm, and Insight Timer are great platforms.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Body Scan Meditation:</strong> A practice that helps you connect with your body by focusing on each part sequentially. Excellent for relaxation and combating physical tension.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Breathwork:</strong> Simple but powerful. Focus solely on your breath, whether it’s deep belly breathing or timed inhales and exhales (e.g., 4-7-8 breathing).
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Practical Tips for Getting Started</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Start Small:</strong> Just 5 minutes a day can make a big difference. Use a timer to stay focused.</li>
                <li><strong>Find a Comfortable Space:</strong> Choose a quiet spot with minimal distractions. Sitting in a chair or on the floor with a cushion works well.</li>
                <li><strong>Use an App:</strong> Apps like Headspace, Calm, and Insight Timer are beginner-friendly and provide structure.</li>
                <li><strong>Consistency Over Perfection:</strong> Don’t worry about clearing your mind completely. Just showing up daily builds the habit.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Benefits of Meditation</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduced stress and anxiety</li>
                <li>Improved focus and clarity</li>
