            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>There’s nothing like a well-made cup of coffee or tea to start the day, but getting it right doesn’t have to break the bank. With just a few simple techniques and the right ingredients, you can brew a top-quality cup every time. Let’s dive into the ideal temperatures, best bean storage methods, how to select the highest quality beans, and tips from Tim Ferriss on brewing without breaking the budget.</p>

            <h2>1. Coffee Temperature: The Secret to a Balanced Brew</h2>
            <p>Temperature plays a huge role in the quality of your coffee. Brewing too hot can create a bitter taste, while too cold can leave your coffee tasting flat.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ideal Brewing Temperature</strong>: Aim for 195°F to 205°F (90°C to 96°C) for most coffee types.</li>
                <li><strong>Budget Tip</strong>: Use a thermometer or let water sit 30 seconds post-boil to hit the perfect temp.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Storing Your Beans: Freshness Is Key</h2>
            <p>Storage is crucial to great coffee flavor. Exposure to light, heat, moisture, and air degrades quality.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Best Practices</strong>: Store beans in an airtight container in a cool, dark place; avoid the fridge.</li>
                <li><strong>Tim Ferriss Insight</strong>: Ferriss recommends using a dark-colored, airtight container to maintain freshness.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Bean Selection: Choosing Quality and Avoiding Harmful Chemicals</h2>
            <p>Quality coffee begins with the beans. Here’s what to look for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Organic & Shade-Grown</strong>: Reduces pesticides and supports eco-friendly farming.</li>
                <li><strong>Single-Origin</strong>: Often indicates careful production and distinct flavors.</li>
                <li><strong>Budget Tip</strong>: Buy whole beans in bulk to save money and maintain quality.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Tea Temperature and Brewing Tips</h2>
            <p>Each type of tea has an optimal brewing temperature and steeping time for best flavor:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Green Tea</strong>: Brew between 160°F to 185°F for 1–3 minutes to avoid bitterness.</li>
                <li><strong>Black Tea</strong>: Brew at 200°F for 3–5 minutes to bring out full flavor.</li>
                <li><strong>Herbal Tea</strong>: Use boiling water and steep 5–7 minutes for max flavor.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Tim Ferriss’ Coffee Hacks for a Better Brew</h2>
            <p>Tim Ferriss, known for his love of coffee, has unique tips to enhance flavor and add health benefits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Add Cinnamon or Coconut Oil</strong>: Cinnamon adds antioxidants; coconut oil gives smooth texture.</li>
                <li><strong>Bulletproof Coffee</strong>: Ferriss blends coffee with grass-fed butter and MCT oil for steady energy.</li>
                <li><strong>Use a French Press</strong>: Ferriss recommends this method for full flavor extraction without filters.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Affordable Coffee and Tea Options Without Sacrificing Quality</h2>
            <p>Buying in bulk and opting for loose-leaf teas or single-origin beans lets you enjoy high-quality beverages at lower costs. Look for organic, fair trade options that meet both quality and affordability.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Crafting an excellent cup of coffee or tea is all about understanding your ingredients and refining the process. From the ideal temperatures to smart storage and bean selection, these simple steps can elevate your daily brew without breaking the bank.
