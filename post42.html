            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>We’ve all been there—one or two too many drinks, and the next morning feels like a punishment. But recovery doesn’t have to be miserable! With some preparation and science-backed strategies, you can wake up feeling much better.</p>

            <h2>1. Start With Hydration</h2>
            <p>Alcohol is a diuretic, meaning it dehydrates you. Rehydrating is key to feeling better. Here’s how:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Electrolyte Drinks:</strong> Opt for sports drinks, coconut water, or electrolyte tablets to replenish lost minerals.</li>
                <li><strong>Plain Water:</strong> Sip water consistently before bed and when you wake up.</li>
                <li><strong>Activated Charcoal:</strong> If taken soon after drinking, it may help absorb some toxins. (Consult with a doctor before use.)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Eat the Right Foods</h2>
            <p>Food can make or break your recovery. Avoid greasy fast food and focus on nutrient-dense options:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> High in cysteine, which helps break down toxins in alcohol.</li>
                <li><strong>Bananas:</strong> Replenish potassium and fight dehydration.</li>
                <li><strong>Oats:</strong> A gentle, healthy option to boost energy and settle your stomach.</li>
                <li><strong>Broth-based Soups:</strong> Hydrating and full of electrolytes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Sleep It Off</h2>
            <p>Sleep is the ultimate recovery tool. Alcohol disrupts deep sleep, so aim for quality rest. Use the following tips:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dark, Quiet Room:</strong> Block out light and noise to sleep soundly.</li>
                <li><strong>Hydrate Before Bed:</strong> Avoid waking up thirsty by sipping water before sleep.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. The Morning After</h2>
            <p>Here’s how to kickstart your recovery the next morning:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Drink Coffee or Tea:</strong> A moderate dose of caffeine can reduce headaches and grogginess.</li>
                <li><strong>Cold Shower:</strong> Wake yourself up and boost circulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Exercise Lightly:</strong> A short walk or yoga session can help your body metabolize alcohol faster.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Supplements That May Help</h2>
            <p>Certain supplements can support recovery:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Vitamin B Complex:</strong> Alcohol depletes B vitamins, which are essential for energy production.</li>
                <li><strong>Milk Thistle:</strong> Supports liver health.</li>
                <li><strong>Ginger:</strong> Great for nausea relief.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>Drinking responsibly is the best way to avoid a hangover altogether, but when the morning after hits, these tips can help you bounce back faster. Listen to your body, rehydrate, eat well, and rest up!</p>
