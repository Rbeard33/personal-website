                <li>Invest in a small battery backup to store solar power.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Alternative Energy Options</h3>
            <p>Consider wind turbines or hydroelectric setups if you live near water or have consistent wind.</p>

            <h2>2. Water Independence: Collect, Conserve, and Filter</h2>
            <h3>Rainwater Harvesting</h3>
            <p>Set up rain barrels connected to your gutter system and use a filtration system to purify collected water.</p>

            <h3>Water Wells</h3>
            <p>If you’re ready for a larger commitment, consider drilling a well for a reliable water source.</p>

            <h2>3. Food Independence: Grow and Store Your Own Food</h2>
            <h3>Gardening for Fresh Produce</h3>
            <p>Start with a few raised beds for vegetables like tomatoes, lettuce, and carrots.</p>

            <h3>Preserving and Storing Food</h3>

            <h2>4. Manage Waste and Sanitation Off-Grid</h2>
            <h3>Composting Toilets</h3>
            <p>Reduce water usage by using a composting toilet that also provides compost for your garden.</p>
