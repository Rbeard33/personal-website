            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Fire extinguishers are a crucial part of home and workplace safety, yet many of us only know the basics—like pulling the pin and squeezing the handle. Understanding where to place them, how often to service them, and which types work best for different fires can make all the difference in an emergency. This guide covers everything from placement and maintenance to when NOT to use them and new products worth considering.</p>

            <h2>1. Where Should Fire Extinguishers Be Located?</h2>
            <p>Fire extinguishers should be accessible in key areas. They’re best placed where fire risks are highest:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Kitchen</strong>: Place nearby (but not next to the stove).</li>
                <li><strong>Garage</strong>: Near flammable materials like gasoline or chemicals.</li>
                <li><strong>Bedrooms & Hallways</strong>: In hallways or near bedrooms for night emergencies.</li>
                <li><strong>Workshops & Basements</strong>: Where tools, electrical equipment, or combustibles are stored.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. How Many Fire Extinguishers Do You Need?</h2>
            <p>The number you need depends on the size of your space and fire risk:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>In Homes</strong>: One extinguisher on each floor, especially near high-risk areas like the kitchen.</li>
                <li><strong>In Workplaces</strong>: Follow safety guidelines (usually one extinguisher per 3,000 sq ft).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. When Do Fire Extinguishers Need Servicing?</h2>
            <p>Fire extinguishers need regular inspection for reliability:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Monthly</strong>: Check the pressure gauge, pin, and tamper seal.</li>
                <li><strong>Annually</strong>: Have a professional inspection.</li>
                <li><strong>Every 6–12 Years</strong>: Schedule a hydrostatic test based on extinguisher type.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. When NOT to Use a Fire Extinguisher</h2>
            <p>Knowing when not to use an extinguisher is crucial:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Oil or Grease Fires</strong>: Avoid water-based extinguishers—use Class K or dry chemical extinguishers.</li>
                <li><strong>Electrical Fires</strong>: Never use water; use a Class C or ABC extinguisher instead.</li>
                <li><strong>Out-of-Control Fires</strong>: If the fire is larger than a trash can, evacuate and call the fire department.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. New Innovations in Fire Extinguishers</h2>
            <p>Exciting new products have emerged in fire safety:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Aerosol Extinguishers</strong>: Lightweight and easy to use, with no pin or hose required.</li>
                <li><strong>Smart Extinguishers</strong>: Integrated with home monitoring for maintenance alerts and tamper notifications.</li>
                <li><strong>All-in-One Extinguishers</strong>: Multi-purpose extinguishers (Class ABC) that work on multiple types of fires, ideal for home use.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Understanding the essentials of fire extinguishers—from placement and maintenance to when not to use them—empowers you to respond effectively in case of a fire. Take a moment today to check your extinguisher locations and condition. A small effort now can make a big difference when you need it most!</p>
