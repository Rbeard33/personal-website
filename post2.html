            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Friday the 13th is known worldwide as an unlucky day filled with superstitions. But where did this idea come from? Is it rooted in ancient fears, historical coincidences, or just modern myth-making? In this blog, we’ll explore the origins of Friday the 13th, how it became the most infamous day in Western culture, and some fun facts to lighten the mood.</p>

            <h2>The Origins of Friday the 13th: Legend and Lore</h2>
            <p>The fear of Friday the 13th is a combination of two things: <strong>the number 13</strong> and <strong>Friday itself</strong>—both of which have historically been viewed with suspicion.</p>

            <h3>The Number 13</h3>
            <p>Many cultures considered the number 12 to be “complete” (12 months in a year, 12 zodiac signs, etc.). Adding one more to 12 felt unnatural and chaotic.</p>

            <h3>Friday’s Reputation</h3>
            <p>In Christianity, Friday is believed to be the day of the <strong>Crucifixion</strong> of Jesus. Over time, the day gained a gloomy reputation. A famous event tied to this date is <strong>Friday, October 13, 1307</strong>, when the <strong>Knights Templar</strong> were arrested and executed by King Philip IV of France.</p>
