            <p>Starting a self-sustaining garden may seem costly upfront, but the long-term savings are undeniable.

            <h2>Essential Tools and Alternatives</h2>
            <p>You don’t need expensive equipment to get started. A sturdy spade, a watering can, and some basic gloves are enough for most tasks. Look for secondhand tools at thrift stores or community swaps. Even household items like milk jugs can double as watering cans.</p>
