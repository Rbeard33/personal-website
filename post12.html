            <p>Investing legend Warren Buffett didn’t start with billions. His journey to wealth was built on principles and strategies that he learned young—especially from his mentor Benjamin Graham and his life-changing read, <em>The Intelligent Investor</em>. Whether you’re aiming for financial freedom or simply want to understand investing better, Buffett’s early strategies hold a treasure trove of wisdom for anyone in their late 20s.</p>

            <h2>1. Embrace the Long Game: "Invest in What You Know"</h2>
            <p>Buffett learned early to play the long game, influenced by Graham’s value investing philosophy. Rather than chasing “hot stocks” or short-term gains, he’d research companies with solid fundamentals.</p>
            <blockquote>Fun Fact: At 11, Buffett made his first investment by buying three shares of Cities Service. This taught him an early lesson in patience!</blockquote>

            <h3>Key Takeaway:</h3>
            <p>Focus on steady growth and make decisions with a long-term view. Avoid the temptation for quick wins.</p>

            <h2>2. Learn from Benjamin Graham: The Power of Value Investing</h2>
            <p>Buffett’s primary inspiration, Benjamin Graham, taught the importance of buying stocks at a “margin of safety.” This concept became foundational for Buffett’s investment approach.</p>
            <blockquote>Fun Fact: <em>The Intelligent Investor</em> was Buffett’s prized read, and he even studied under Graham at Columbia University.</blockquote>

            <h3>Key Takeaway:</h3>
            <p>Look for undervalued opportunities in any field. Quality and reliability are often hidden in plain sight.</p>

            <h2>3. Avoid the Crowd: Independent Thinking is Your Superpower</h2>
            <p>Buffett credits his success to staying true to his own research, avoiding “market noise.” Independent thinking guided him to success.</p>
            <blockquote>Fun Fact: Even young Buffett didn’t follow trends, choosing stocks like See’s Candies and Geico long before they became popular.</blockquote>

            <h3>Key Takeaway:</h3>
            <p>Trust your research over trends. Standing by your convictions is key to building a unique, fulfilling path.</p>

            <h2>4. Be a Lifelong Learner: Buffett’s Autodidactic Approach</h2>
            <p>Buffett reportedly spends 80% of his day reading. His passion for knowledge has fueled his success.</p>
            <blockquote>Fun Fact: Buffett advises reading 500 pages a day. While that’s a big goal, small daily learning can make a huge impact.</blockquote>

            <h3>Key Takeaway:</h3>
            <p>Build a habit of daily learning. Podcasts, audiobooks, or articles can all accumulate to big insights over time.</p>

            <h2>5. Focus on Mental Models: Buffett’s Decision-Making Approach</h2>
            <p>Buffett sharpened his decision-making by using mental models, such as “compounding” and “opportunity cost.”</p>
            <blockquote>Fun Fact: Charlie Munger, Buffett’s business partner, also advocates for mental models to simplify complex problems.</blockquote>

            <h3>Key Takeaway:</h3>
            <p>Learn frameworks that help you think critically—confirmation bias, opportunity cost, and first principles thinking are a great start.</p>

            <h2>6. Know What You Don’t Know: The Humble Approach to Expertise</h2>
            <p>Buffett sticks to his “circle of competence,” investing in industries he understands well. Admitting what he doesn’t know has prevented mistakes.</p>
            <blockquote>Fun Fact: Buffett was once hesitant about tech stocks but later invested in Apple after fully understanding it.</blockquote>

            <h3>Key Takeaway:</h3>
            <p>Admitting when you’re unsure helps avoid costly mistakes. Lean into strengths and seek guidance where needed.</p>

            <h2>7. Invest in Yourself: A Lesson on Growth from Buffett</h2>
            <p>Buffett believes the best investment is in oneself. He once took a Dale Carnegie public speaking course, which he credits as a pivotal point in his career.</p>
            <blockquote>Fun Fact: Buffett overcame a deep fear of public speaking through this course. He now encourages everyone to invest in communication skills.</blockquote>

            <h3>Key Takeaway:</h3>
            <p>Whether it’s learning a new skill, building confidence, or expanding your network, self-investment pays dividends over time.</p>

            <h2>Final Thought: What Would Buffett Do?</h2>
            <p>When in doubt, ask, “What would Warren do?” Buffett’s principles—like value investing, lifelong learning, and independent thinking—are great guides for anyone aiming for steady, meaningful growth.</p>

            <blockquote>Closing Fun Fact: Despite his wealth, Buffett still lives in the house he bought in 1958 for $31,500, showing that wealth to him is about freedom and purpose—not flashiness.</blockquote>
