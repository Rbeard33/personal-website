            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Tony Robbins' <em>Money: Master the Game</em> is full of practical insights on building wealth and securing financial independence. Some of the most powerful ideas are about <strong>index funds</strong>, <strong>the All-Weather Portfolio</strong>, and the importance of working with a <strong>fiduciary</strong> advisor. Let’s explore why these concepts stand out and how they can help you build a more resilient financial future.</p>

            <h2>1. Index Funds: Simple, Low-Cost Investing</h2>
            <p>An index fund is a type of investment fund that aims to match the performance of a market index, like the S&P 500. Instead of picking individual stocks, index funds pool together stocks from hundreds or thousands of companies in one fund.</p>
            <blockquote>Example: Instead of buying individual tech or energy stocks, an S&P 500 index fund gives you shares in 500 of the largest U.S. companies.</blockquote>

            <h2>2. The All-Weather Portfolio: Building Resilience in Any Market</h2>
            <p>Developed by Ray Dalio, the All-Weather Portfolio is designed to perform well under all economic conditions—whether the market is booming, stagnant, or in a downturn. The idea is to <strong>diversify your assets</strong> across different types of investments to minimize risk and maximize returns over the long term.</p>
            <blockquote>Example Breakdown: 30% Stocks, 40% Bonds, 15% Intermediate Bonds, 7.5% Gold, 7.5% Commodities</blockquote>

            <h2>3. Fiduciary Responsibility: Why It Matters When Choosing an Advisor</h2>
            <p>A fiduciary is a financial advisor legally required to act in your best interest. This concept is emphasized because not all advisors are bound by fiduciary duty.</p>
            <blockquote>Example: Imagine working with a non-fiduciary advisor suggesting a high-fee mutual fund over a low-cost index fund.</blockquote>

            <h2>How to Start Applying These Ideas Today</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Explore Index Funds:</strong> Look for low-cost index funds from providers like Vanguard or Fidelity.</li>
                <li><strong>Consider the All-Weather Portfolio:</strong> Use similar asset allocations or robo-advisors that offer diversified strategies.</li>
                <li><strong>Work with a Fiduciary Advisor:</strong> Verify your advisor’s fiduciary status and ask about their fee structure.</li>
            </ul>
